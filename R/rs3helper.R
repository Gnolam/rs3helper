#' Python wrapper of boto s3 library
#'
#'
#' \code{rs3helper} is a collection of functions on AWS S3.
#' Each function is backed by a Python script that performs an action on the boto library - boto is probably the most popular interface to Amazon Web Services in Python.
#' In this regards, this package can be considered as a Python wrapper of boto S3 library.
#' For those who are interested in a native R package, see the aws.s3 package of the cloudyr project.
